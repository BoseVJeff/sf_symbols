# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy static content to Pages

  # Runs on pushes targeting the `web-demo` branch
  # This is done so that broken builds in the default branch do not affect the demo.
  # This also allows for a certain level of seperation of concerns.
